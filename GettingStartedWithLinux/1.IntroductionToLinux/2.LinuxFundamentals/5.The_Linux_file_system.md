## The File System

- FIles and directories make up the file system
- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standart `FHS` describes how the file system is organised
  - Helps to ensure consistent locations across distributions
- The top level of the file system is called the root and is represented by `/` (slash)
  - `/mnt` `/media` - used to mount or attach other file systems
  - `/home` - each user personal files are stored here
  - `/bin` `/sbin` `/usr` - programs of different types are stored here
  - `/etc` - system-like configuration files
  - `/var` - variable changed files
  - `/dev` `/proc` `/sys` - created by the kernel to represent hardware available on the system,
    including all the systems hardware, processes that run programs, settings in the kernel and so on.
- There's only one file system root on the system
  - Everything else is attached, or mounted, within the file system.
  - External drives mount in `/mnt` or `/media`.
- "File system" has two meanings

## Planning Your System
1. Decide what your learning goal is.
2. Decide which distro supports that goal.
3. Decide where your Linux environmenr will run.

## Which Distro
- Need a desktop environment
  - Consider Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Mint
- No desktop needed
  - Consider Ubuntu Server, Debian Server
  - Arch or Alpine can be interesting to explore

## Where should it run
- Virtual Machine
- Native install
- Live boot

## Virtual Machine
- Provides a protected space to run an OS
  - Remains isolated from your `real` computer
- Many products provide VM capability
  - VirtualBox, Hyper-V, VMware, and others
  - Look for product-specifinc courses to learn more

## Native install
- Install Linux directly on a commputer
  - Replaces the existing OS and data
- Consider performance
  - For learning the machine doesn't need to be powerful
  - Native install allows use of computer's full resources
- Small compuers like `Raspberry Pi` or `Intel NUC` can be used

## Live boot
- Boot a Linux from an installation disk
  - Doesn't affect the computer it runs on at all
- Easy, but has some drawbacks
  - Can be slow
  - Won't save modified files; use other storage to keep them

## Cloud Services
- Not recommended if you need a desktop
  - Great for remote access through SSH to a text interface
- Many hosting providers are available
  - Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Linode, and more
- Many providers offer a free ervice; some require payment
- Requires remote connection through SSH

## Windows subsystem for Linux
- Easily create a Linux VM on a Windows 10 system
  - Many distros available in the Microsoft Store
  - Ideal for shell access

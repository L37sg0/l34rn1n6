## Adding Software to your Linux System
- Find and install software in distribution repositories.
- Repositories are collections of software packages.
- Package management software uses package files to install software in the appropriate places on the system.
- Build software from source code
  - Use development tools, like a compiler, to create executables from source code
  - Some complex programs use `Makefiles` to guide the process
- Use isolated, platform-independent software bundles
  - Examples include `Snaps`, `Flatpack`, and `AppImage`

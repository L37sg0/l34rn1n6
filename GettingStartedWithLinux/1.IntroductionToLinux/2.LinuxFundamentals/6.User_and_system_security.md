## Use Accounts on Linux
- Standart users
  - Human users and programs or services can have their own account
  - Can't access the files that belong to other users, unless specifically granted permission to do so.
- Superuser `root`
  - Can access any file on the system (and make system-wide changes).
  - Standart users can use the root's privileges if they're empowered to do so with `su` or `sudo`.
  - It's common to borrow the superuser privileges to perform maintenance or install software.
  - It is not recommended to use the computer for normal tasks as root.
 
## Single-User Mode
- Single-user mode is available on most Linux distributions for troubleshooting purposes.
- The single user in such mode is `root`.
- Some embedded systems and containers use single-user mode.

## File Permissions
- Permissions represent what rights a user has to a iven file
- They can be numeric `755` or symbolic `rwxr-xr-x`
- The `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp` commands are used to work with permissions
- **SELinux or AppArmor provice additional levels of a security on a Linux system.**

## Distributions
- Kind of like different flavours of the operation system
- They all include the linux kernel.

## What makes a Distro
- Preinstalled tools.
- Decisions about how the system will be configured and how it operates.
- What software is available through repositories.
- How and how long a distro is supported.
- Which variation of the Linux kernel is used.
- Core Utilities - GNU coreutils, BusyBox, or other toolkits.
- Purpose-specific tools - servers, utilities, configuration, desktop.
- Network configuration - `Netplan`,`NetworkManager` or others.
- Package managers - `apt`, `dnf`, `apk`, `zypper` or others.
- System manager - `systemd` or `SysVinit`.
- Privilege management - `Debian` doesn't include `sudo`; other distros do.
- **The same software on different distros may  have different names `Apache HTTP Server` is `apache2` on `Ubuntu` nad `https` on `RedHat`**
- Check your distro info via `cat /etc/*.release`
- Distro maintainers are organisations, companies, or individuals who make the choices that define the distro and continue to make changes to update it over time
- Most distros are intended for particulat use cases,
like servers, desktop use, containers, or embedded systems.
- Most distros are derived from upstream distros

## Which Distro Should I Use
- Some people recommend starting from first principles, like minimalistic with `Arch`
- Start with `Ubuntu`, unless you have other requirements(such as whichever distro your company uses)
- If you pick a distro and you don't like it, try another one
- If you pick a distro and you love it, try another one too.
- Keep in mind that `Debian/Ubuntu` and `RedHAt/CentOS` are usually the best represented in tutorials and help articles, because they are so widelly used.

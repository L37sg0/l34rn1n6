## Interacting with a Linux system

- Through desktop environment
- Through shell

## Linux desktop environments
- We can install and switch between various desktop environments.
- Many distributions make a choice about which desktop they use.
- Popular desktop environments include:
  - GNOME Shell
  - KDE
  - Plasma Desktop
  - LXQt
  - Cinnamon
  - MATE
  - Xfce
 
## Linux Shell
- The shell is software we use to type commands and view returned text.
- Popular shells include:
  - Bash
  - Zsh
  - csh
  - fish
  - ksh
- Being familiar with Bash is a good start.
- A shell ca run inside of a terminal emulator in a GUI or in text mode as a console.
- Can be used locally or remotely.
- Software like Secure Shell `SSH` enable remote connections to a text-based console or terminal.

## Using the Shell
- What you need to do will determine how much you need to use the shell.
- Many people use both the shell and desktop environment to get work done.
- If you plan to use the shell, deccide whether you want to connect via the network or use the console directly.

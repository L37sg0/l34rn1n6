## Encrypting a Disk
- On Linux we can use cryptsetup and `LUKS` (Linux Unified Key Setup)
  - list your disks with `lsblk`
  - create a partition on selected disk with `sudo fdisk </dev/sdc>`
  - `sudo luksformat -t ext4 </dev/sdc1>` - asks for a password and creates new encrypted volume on the partition
  - `sudo cryptsetup open </dev/sdc1> securefiles` - asks for password and maps the encrypted volume to `securefiles` directory inside `/dev/mapper`
  - `sudo mkdir /mnt/securestorage && sudo mount dev/mapper/securefiles /mnt/securestorage`
  - `sudo chmod 777 /mnt/securestorage/` gives permission to the encrypted storage.
  - `sudo umount /mnt/securestorage` - unmounts the encrypted volume
  - `sudo cryptssetup close securefiles` - closes the encrypted volume.
- Encryption doesn't protect data on the disk while it's open or mounted.
- A passphrase is needed whenever the disk is opened, before it can be mounted.
- Decide how to secure your data.

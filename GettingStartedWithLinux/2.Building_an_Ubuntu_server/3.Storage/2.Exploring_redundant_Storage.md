## Exploring Redundant Storage
- Redundant storage helps protect data against loss due to disk failure.
- It's common to store files intended for sharing on redundant volumes.
- Physical disks can be combined in a variety of ways to provide different levels of protection against failure.
- **Redundancy is not a backup**
- Consider the various options when deciding whether to use redundancy.

## RAID
- Stands for `Redundant Array of Independent Disks`.
- Time-honored way of creating redundant storage.
- Can create mirrored or striped volumes.
- Is described in levels.
- Level 0 is `JBOD` and doesn't provide redundancy.
- Level 1 is mirroring, and 5 and 6 are more redundant, RAID 6 is recommended.
- Is often managed through the `mdadm` software.

## LVM
- Stands for `Logical Volume Manager`.
- Creates and manages flexible volumes.
- Calls physical disks PVs and arranges them in VGs.
- Uses LVs within VGs to represent user-facinig storage volumes.
- LVs can be moved between PVs and VGs, allowing file systems to be moved between hardware as needed.
- LVM is more flexible than RAID but also more complex.

## ZFS
- Combines file system and volume manager in one technology.
- Uses Vdevs made up pf disks to create pools, where we can create file systems and block devices.
- File systems and block devices can be moved to other pools on different hardware.
- Uses `copy-on-write`(`COW`), making it easy to create and restore snapshots.

## BTRFS
- Name represents B-tree file system.
- File system that manages file integrity and includes some RAID features.
- Is resilient against some data corruption problems.
- Unlike RAID, it can be used on a single disk.

## Redundancy Recap
- RAID with mdadm is straightforward.
- LVM provides flexibility at the cost of complexity.
- ZFS and BTRFS are popular in various applications.
- Storage administration is a good skill to learn.

## Automatically Mount Disks
- The system can automatically make disks available at boot time.
- Settings for disk mounting are found in the file system table at `/etc/fstab`.
- The `fstab` file contains options similar to what are used when manually mounitng a file system.
- to find the UUID of a partition use `blkid`

## Automatically Mount Disks
- The system can automatically make disks available at boot time.
- Settings for disk mounting are found in the file system table at `/etc/fstab`.
- The `fstab` file contains options similar to what are used when manually mounitng a file system.
- to find the UUID of a partition use `sudo blkid`
- if already mounted partitions manually use `df -h` to see where are mounted
- then open `/etc/fstab` and add a line for each partition you want to be auto-mounted
- **example**
  ```bash
  # /dev/nvme1n1p5 for containers
  UUID=1f25f909-51e5-4a47-b7f4-1185554a0b5f /var/lib/docker ext4 defaults 0 2
  ```
- save file and close
- check for mounting errors with `sudo mount -a`

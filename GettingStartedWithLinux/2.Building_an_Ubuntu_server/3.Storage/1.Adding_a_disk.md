## First
- Add the disk
- use `lsblk` to show block devices and check if system recognises the new device
- use `sudo lshw -businfo -c disk` to see which particular disk is associated with which particular name

## Create partitions on the new disk
- create a partition on the new disk `sudo fdisk </dev/sda>`
  - use program help to follow what need to be done
  - changes remain in memory untill you confirm them
  - **example**
  ```bash
  n # creates new partition

  Partition type:
   p   primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free) # Use primary only if you're adding a disk which need to have OS on it
   e   extended (container for logical partitions) # In all other cases create 1 extended partition over all space and add logical partitions on it
  Select (default p):  p

  Partition number (1-4, default 2): 2
  First sector (499712-488397134, default 499712): # press Enter
  Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (499712-488397134, default 488397134): +1T # will create 1TB partition

  # write changes with:
  w
  ```
- after chages being applied you'll be able to see your disk and its partitions with `lsblk`

## Create a file system on the disk
- identify partition name on which you want to create a file system with `lsblk`
- use `sudo mkfs.ext4 </dev/sda>` to create an `ext4` file system on selected partition

## Mount your new files system
- create new mounting directory `sudo mkdir </mnt/storage>`
- now mount new disk to existing file system `sudo mount </dev/sda1> </mnt/storage>`
- finaly check with `df -h` that the new disk is available.

**Disks are usualy monted by `root`, which means only root have read,write and execute rights on them**

## Change permissions of the new disk
- `sudo chmod <777> </mnt/storage>`

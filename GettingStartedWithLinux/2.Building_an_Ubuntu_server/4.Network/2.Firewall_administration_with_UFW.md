## Uncomplicated Firewall `UFW`
- Acts as a front-end for the netfilter packet filtering software
- More approachable for beginners than iptables
- Determines what network activity is allowed to reach software on the server
- Controls access by port, protocol, source, destination, and more
- By default `ufw` is not running on Ubuntu server

## Usage
- `ufw allow 22` - allows any traffic from any protocol from any IP address to port 22 of the server
- In production environments we need to be more speciffic on `ufw` rules, filtering via IP, protocol and type of traffic (in, out)
- `sudo ufw enable` - enables the firewall
- `sudo ufw status` - lists all added rules in firewall
- `sudo ss -anspst` - shows listening addresses, ports and processes responsible for those ports
- `sudo ufw delete allow 3389` - will delete rule `allow 3389`
- `sudo ufw status numbered` - show rules with numbers
- `sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp` - adds a rule sprecifying the protocol `tcp`

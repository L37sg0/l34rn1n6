## File Sharing
- Provide network clients access to locally stored files
- Samba provides cross-platform file sharing
- `SMB` is short for Server Message Block
- `CIFS` other name of `SMB`

## Usage
- installation - `sudo apt install samba`
- configuration - `sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf`
- example config for file sharing
  ```bash
  [storage]
    comment = Shared Storage
    path = /mnt/storage
    read only = no
    valid users = storageuser
  ```
  - use `testparm` to check if configuration is OK
  - `sudo useradd storageuser` to create the user for samba
  - `sudo smbpasswd -a storageuser` - to add samba-only password for the user
  - `sudo ufw allow 139/tcp` to open port for linux and macOS users to connect to the server
  - `sudo ufw allow 445/tcp` to allow windows clients to connect
  - `sudo ssytemctl restart smbd` - t restart the service and apply changes

  **When providing access t more than one users, you'll also need to manage permissions alongside the Samba service**

## Secure Shell
- Allows remote administration through the network
- SSH Client software is available for all platforms
- Ubuntu Server can be configured at installation to run OpenSSH Server
- The OpenSSH Server is referred to as SSHD
- `systemctl status sshd` - show status of the ssh service
- `/etc/sshd/sshd.config` - the configuration of the ssh service
  - best practice is to use a PubkeyAuthentication instead of password
 
## Copying files with SSH: SCP and SFTP
- Copy from a local system to a remote system
  - `scp ~/myfile user@hostaddress:remotedir`
- Copy from a remote system to a local system:
  - just reverse the arguments of the previous
- SSH also provides SFTP, which operates like FTP rather than cp.

## SSH Tunnels
- Create a connection between systems using SSH
- Traffic from the client can appear to come from the server
- Often used to access protected or private services

## System Logs

### Text Logs
- Stored in `/var/log`
- Managed by `rsyslog`
- Readable with text-based tools
- Can become difficult to use if there are many entries

### Binary Logs
- Accessed through `journalctl`
- Managed by `systemd-journald`
- Not as easy to work with using text-based tools
- More flexible and easy to query

### Important Text Logs

## System and hardware information

### Hardware information
- `lshw` - returns information about available hardware in the system - multiple ways of using it:
  - `sudo lshw | less` - pipe to less where you can scroll or search with `/<wordToSearchFor>`
  - `sudo lshw -class <wordToSearchFor>` - returns only the matched blocks
  - `sudo lshw -html > hw.html` - exports the output to an html file, which can be read in the browser
  - `sudo lshw > hw.txt` - exports the output to a text file, which can be read with any text editor, `nano` for example
  - use `man lshw` for more usage information
- `lsblk` - shows us information about block-storage devices which the system is aware of, including hard drives, and also loop devices, which are files containing a file system
  - useful to see what storage devices the system has, are they mounted and where, and how they are partitioned
- `blkid` - info about partitions
- `lsmem` - info about system memory
  - `lsmem -a` - info about system memory blocks
- `lscpu` - details about the processor
- `cat proc/cpuinfo` - per core cpu information
- `lspci -tv` - list devices attached to PCI controller in a tree view
- `lspci -v` - detailed information about available PCI devices
- `lsusb -tv` - list devices on the USB bus in a tree view

### System information
- `lsb_release -a` - release information about currently installed Linux distro
  - same info can be found by `cat /etc/os-release /etc/lsb-release`
- `uname -rv` - see what release of kernel is being used
- `hostnamectl` - also provides some information not for the hostname only, but also for the OS

## Managing Processes
- Software runs in a process
- We refer to a processes by their number or process ID (PID)
- `ps` - command for managing processes
  - `-e` - processes across system
  - `man ps` - manual for `ps`
- `kill` - for sending signals to processes
  - `man kill` for more information
- Processes respond to signals.
- We control what's running by interacting with processes.
- Working with processes is important, but we'll often use services instead.

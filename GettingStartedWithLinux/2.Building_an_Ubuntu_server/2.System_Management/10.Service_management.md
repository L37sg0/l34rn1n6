## Managing services
- Services provide functionality to users
- Services are programs that run all the times
- Services respond to requests
- Examples are `web servers`, `database servers`, `ssh server`, and so on
- Some services are external facing and others are used by the system
- Services are controlled through `systemctl` on Ubuntu

- `systemctl` - shows all services running
  - `systemctl status rsyslog/service` - example showing how to check status of a service
    - `loaded` - means its loaded
    - `active` - means its running
    - `enabled` - means will start at system boot
  - `systemctl start <service>` - start a service
  - `systemctl stop <service>` - stops a service
  - `systemctl restart <service>` - restarts a service
  - `systemctl enable <service>` - enable seervice to start on boot
  - `systemctl disable <service>` - do not start service on boot

## `APT` package Manager
- Ubuntu uses `APT` for package management.
- `APT` interacts with `dpkg` for package installation tasks.
- `APT` can search software repositories for available software and install dependencies, recommended packages, and suggested packages.

## Usage
- `sudo apt update` - updates the local package list.
- `apt list <packageWeWant>` or `apt search <wordWeSearchFor>` - to find or search for available packages.
- `apt show <packageName>` - descriptive information about the package.
- `sudo apt install <packageName>` - install a package.
- `sudo apt remove <packageName>` - removes a package from the system

## System Software repositories
- `cat /etc/apt/sources.list` - prints info for repositories which the system is aware of.

## Headless Servers
- Many servers run headless, or without a display attached.
- They are accessed, and managed, remotely through a network connection.

## Linux Desktop Environments
- There are many desktop environments, including GNOME, Plasma, Cinnamon, LXQt, Xfce, and more.
- Any of them can be installed on Ubuntu Server.
- GNOME is the default desktop environment on Ubuntu systems.

## Installing GNOME on Ubuntu Server
- `sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop`
- once installed need to restart the server - `sudo shutdown -r now`
- now can swich from `ssh` management to a regular monitor display.
- to witch from GUI to console use `Ctrl+Alt+F2`
- also can use the desktop environment remotely through protocols like `VNC` or `RDP`
  - `RDP` is more secure and easier to set and run.
  - can be installed with `sudo apt install xrdp`
  - `sudo usermod -aG ssl-cert xrdp` - allow the `xrdp` to access certificates
  - `sudo ufw allow 3389` - open a port for `xrdp` in the firewall.
  - then make some settings to allow `xrdp` to run the environment remotely
    - `sudo nano /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh`
    - at the bottom of file insert 2 lines
      ```bash
      ...
      unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
      unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
      ```
    - this allows the sesion to be set up and work more or less correctly.
    - without these lines you might experience a black screen when try to connect.
  - Then on the remote computer use software like `remmina` to access the server desktop remotely through `RDP`

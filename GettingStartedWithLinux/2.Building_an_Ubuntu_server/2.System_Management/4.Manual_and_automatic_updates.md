## Manual update
- `sudo apt update` - ask for the most recent versions of software repositories, and show how many packages can be upgraded
- `sudo apt upgrade` - get any available updates
- `sudo reboot` - reboot the system if needed to apply updates
- `sudo apt autoremove` - remove outdated software from the system

## Automated updates
- `sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades`
- Unattended upgrades tool automatically installs updates to installed software, including security upgrades, shortly after they've become available

**Important**
- **Only one instance of the package manager should run at once. If an automated process is using it, wait for it to finish - don't end it abruptly.**

## Updating to a new release
- Use `do-release-upgrade` to upgrade a system to a new release
- Move from an LTS release to the next LTS release
- Move from an LTS release to a non-LTS release by setting `Prompt=normal` in `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades`
- Remember to use `tmux` or `screen` if connected remotely

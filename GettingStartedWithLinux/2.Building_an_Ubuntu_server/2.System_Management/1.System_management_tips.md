## System management tips

### Hostname
-`hostnamectl` - tool for managing hostname of the server
- `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <newServerHostName>` - change hostname of your server and reboot to apply

### Date and time
- `date` - tool to check time on server - default timezone is `UTC`(Universal Time Zone) - mostly used when have multiple servers across the world, so they be synced one another
- Clock of server is automatically synchronized using `NTP`(Network Time Protocol) - if has access to internet
- Ways to change time settings of server:
  - `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` - opens a tool to change your timezone
  - `timezonectl list-timezones` - list available timezones, `sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Sofia` - set current timezone to Europe/Sofia

### Using Tmux or Screen for Persistence
- Prevent disconnections from affecting processes started through SSH
- Unexpected session terminations can cause problems
- Solution is to use multiplexers like `tmux` or `screen` to solve this problem
  - A multiplexer provides a shell session that can detach from the current session and keeps running, even if `SSH` connection is unexpectedly terminated
  - Example of use case - when updating the system with the package manager, so unexpected `SSH` termination not leave you with broken server
- **Tmux**
  - If not installed install with `sudo apt install tmux`, then run `tmux` to open a pane
  - To open another pane press `Ctrl+B` then `C`
  - Switch between panes - `Ctrl+B` followed by `P` for previous, or `N` for next
  - `tmux attach` to connect to the existing session
  - To close a pane `Ctrl+B` then `X`
  - To disconnect from `tmux` but leave it running in background `Ctrl+B` then `D`, or write in pane `tmux detach`
  - Tmux will keep running untill system is rebooted
- For more info about multiplexers `screen` and `tmux` - see [Linux: Multitasking at the Command Line](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/linux-multitasking-at-the-command-line-18466403/command-line-multitasking)

### Restarting and Shutting down
- `sudo shutdown -r` - restart the system
- `sudo shutdown -h` - power off the system
- add the `now` argument to any of the above to execute immidiatelly

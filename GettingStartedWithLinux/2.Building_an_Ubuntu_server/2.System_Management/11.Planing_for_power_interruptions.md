## Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
- Protects hardware from power anomalies or outages.
- Often lasts long enough to safely shut down hardware.
- Can comunicate with a computer and tell it to shut down via the vendor software of the UPS.

## Power Protection Strategy
- Plan for a UPS with the capacity to run your server for at least 10 minutes or so.
- Factor in the worst-case time it might take to shut down your server safely.
- Avoid having the server shut down at the first hint of trouble.
- Routinely check the battery capacity and replace it when necessary.
- Seek out features and settings that make sense for your use case.

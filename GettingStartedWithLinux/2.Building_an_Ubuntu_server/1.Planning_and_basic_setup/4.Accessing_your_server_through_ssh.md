## Remote Access with SSH
- Secure Shell `SSH` allows us to access a system via the network
- `SSH` provides a text-based shell session we can use to administer the server
- For more information see [Learning Linux Command Line](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linux-command-line-14447912/learning-linux-command-line)
- `SSH` client software is available for all major platforms
- `ssh <username>@<serverIPaddress>`
- Many administrators find using `SSH` easier than using a system directly.
- Challenge yourself to try using `SSH` to accomplish your tasks.

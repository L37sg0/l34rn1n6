## Production or Home Server
- What roles will it provide, and what hardware is needed to support them?
- Consider buying new hardware.

## Lab Server
- What roles can existing hardware support?
- Consider repurposing existing hardware.

## Recommendations
- Ubuntu server doesn't have Bluethooth and Wi-Fi support available right out of the box
- Ubuntu SErver can perform network tasks like DHCP and routing, but wewon't focus on those here
- Consider using a moderately sized SSd for your system disk
- Consider the costs and benefits of SSD versus HDD hardware
- Don't overload the server with roles and tasks
- Plan RAM and storage carefully so there's enough for what you plan to need
- Choose a processor that's capable of keeping up with what you ask of it
- Moderately old processors will often still have good performance
- Consider other hardware that services might require, such as the GPU
- Balance resources with requirements
- If you have time, build test servers with different configurations
- If others rely on the server's services, the system needs to be reliable
- Don't be afraid to rebuild lab servers
- Challenge yourself to work through the command line.

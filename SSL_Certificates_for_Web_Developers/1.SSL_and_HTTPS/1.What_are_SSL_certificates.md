## What are SSL certificates

#### SSL Certificate
- Triggers the "little padlock" or green bar in a browser
- That indicates the webpage is using HTTPS for secure communication
- Certifies the ownership of a public key
- The public key is used for encrypting data sent between a browser and a remote server
- SSL: stands for "Secure Sockets Layer"
- It's a cryptographic protocol for communication security
- TLS: stands for "Transport Layer Security" - 1999 - superrior version that's become far more common than SSL
- Certificates are not dependent on the protocol used, they just certify the public key and that those two protocols are using that public key
- The name SSL just stuck as a name, although nobody uses SSL for communication, but instead TLS is used

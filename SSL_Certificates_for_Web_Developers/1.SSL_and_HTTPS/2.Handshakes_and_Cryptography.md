## Handshakes and Cryptography

#### Symmetric-Key Cryptography
- Encrypt data using a password
- Decrypt data using the same password
- Symmetric-Key means using same key(password) both for encryption and decryption

#### Public Key Cryptography
- Asymmetric-Key Cryptography - the key(password) is different for encryption and decryption
- Instead we have a pair of mathematically linked numbers
  - these are numbers derived from multiplying prime numbers together
- We refer to those numbers as `Public Key` and `Private key`
- Private key should always be kept secret and secure
- Public key can be shared widely
- Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the private key

#### SSL/TLS Handshakes
- A browser sends a request to a secure server
- The server sends back its SSL certificate, which include the public key and other data about the server's identity
- The browser confirms the SSL certificate is valid
- The browser encrypts a very long password using the public key and sends it to the server
- The server decrypts the data using its private key and retrieves the password
- **The server and browser now both possess the same password**
- **Now they use the shared password to encrypt all future communications with Symmetric-Key cryptography**

#### Private and Efficient
- Public key cryptography
  - Private communications in public
  - Issue is algorithms are quite slow
- Symmetric-key cryptography
  - Fast algorythms
  - Issue is it is difficult to send securely the key in public
  - 
#### This is why Handshakes are used - we get best of both cryptography technologies

#### Recap
- SSL certificate certifies ownership of public key
- Public key is used to exchange a password in public
- Password is then used to encrypt all data between browser and server
  - Passwords are temporary and not reused

## Purchased Certificates

#### Certificate Signing Request
- Do not use online CSR generators
- First step is creating a public-private key pair
- Private key could be compromised
- Always create key-pairs locally

#### The Right Way
- Install OpenSSL
- Generate a key pair
- Create a CSR
- Enter organization information
- ```bash
  # Generate a private key
  openssl genrsa -out domain.key 2048
  # Generate a CSR
  openssl req -new -key domain.key -out domain.csr

  # Generate both a private key and a CSR in a single step
  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout domain.key -out domain.csr
  ```
  - CSR is the public key which we want to upload to the CA
  - Private key is what we want to stay on our server to enable public-key cryptography to work

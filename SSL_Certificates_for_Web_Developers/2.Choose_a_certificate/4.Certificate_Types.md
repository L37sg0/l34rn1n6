## Certificate Types

#### Domain Scope
- Single domain (www.coolsite.com)
- Wildcard (*.coolsite.com)
- Multi-domain (coolsite.com, greatsite.org, coolsite.net)
- Unified Communication/Subject Alternative Name

#### Validation Levels
- Domain Validation (DV) - most common, certify that website and public key are related against `whois`
- Organisation validation (OV) - same as DV, but also confirms the authencity of the organisation, by checking business databases for articles of incorporation, and confirmin the physical address of the business
- Extended validation (EV) - same as OV, but an actual human person contacts the public phone of the business

- Domain validation is the cheapest, fastest, and easyest
- Extended validation is the most expensive
- CAs want to sell you extended validation
- The added value of extended validation is questionable, but many browsers will display it differently with a big green bar at the top
  - Issue is hackers can buy EV certificates too !
 
- If your goal is to encrypt or to prevent browsers from complaining, pick domain validation
- If your goal is to provide the highest reassurance to customers, pick extended validation

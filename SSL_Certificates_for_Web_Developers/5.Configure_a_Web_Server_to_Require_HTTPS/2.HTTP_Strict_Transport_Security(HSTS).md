## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

- Instruct web browsers to only interact with a website using HTTPS
- Web browser remembers
- Web browser automatically redirects to HTTPS
- **Protects us against downgrade and man-in-the-middle attacks**

#### Steps
- Add a directive to the HTTP header
  - "Strict-Transport-Security"
  - "max-age=300; includeSubdomains;"
- Restart the web server

#### Configuration in Apache
```conf
<VirtualHost 192.0.0.1:443>
  # ...

  Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=300; includeSubdomains;"
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Configuration in NGINX
```conf
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name youdomain.com;
  # ...

  add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=300; includeSubdomains;";
}
```

**Now browsers will know to always use HTTPS with your website**

#### Requirements
- Increase max-age over time, start with small number
  - Max-age:300 seconds = 5 minutes
  - Max-age: 604800 seconds = 1 week
  - Max-age: 2592000 seconds = 1 month
  - **Golden standart is Max-age: 63072000 seconds = 2 years**
  - **Reason for 2 years is once we get there we can advantage of something called HSTS preloading**

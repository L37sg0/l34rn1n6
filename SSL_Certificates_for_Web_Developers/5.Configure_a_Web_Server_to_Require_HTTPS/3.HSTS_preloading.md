## HSTS preloading

#### Steps untill now
- User goes to http://
- Request is sent using HTTP on port 80
- Web server sends back redirect to HTTPS
- Request is sent from browser using HTTPS on port 443
- Web server sends back header with HSTS directive

#### Why we need HSTS preloading
- Browser keeps a global list of HTTPS-only sites
- This feature is available on Chrome and most major browsers like Firefox, Safari etc.
- Chrome are the ones started this project and maintainers of the global list
- `max-age` should be at least 1 year for a website to appear in this list, preffered 2 years
  - "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload"
- finally you can go to https://hstspreload.org and submit your website

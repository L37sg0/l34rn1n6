## Authorization Code Flow with PKCE

#### First step answer the questions
- Are you authorizing on behalf of a user ? - Yes, so we could use it in addition to OIDC
- Does the system in question have a web browser available ? - Yes
- Is the application entirely server side or does it have a client-side component ? - Our app will have a client-side component. So we should use PKCE, formerly called Implicit Grant Type.

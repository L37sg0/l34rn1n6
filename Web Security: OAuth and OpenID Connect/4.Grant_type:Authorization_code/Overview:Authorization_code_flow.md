## OAuth 2.0: Authorization Code Flow

![auth_code_flow](https://github.com/L37sg0/l34rn1n6/assets/20823029/653d2058-b5d7-40b0-8142-66a92db74ba6)

##### Thee Authorization code Flow eliminates most of the risk. Less risk == fewer security issues.

#### Benefits
- Only the one-time-use authorization code is exposed
- The application never sees the user's credentials
- The user never sees the access or refresh tokens

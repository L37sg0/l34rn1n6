## Grant Type Overview

#### Six Grant types
- Authorization Code
- Implicit or Hybrid
- Resource Owner Password - special case, when we have legacy server-side app, that we want to move to OAuth. It's a transitional use case, not for regular or long term usage.
- Client Credentials
- Device Code
- Authorization Code with PKCE

#### Key Questions when choosing grant types
- Are you authorizing on behalf of a user ?
- Does the system in question have a browser available ?
- Is the application entirely server side, or does it have a client-side component ?

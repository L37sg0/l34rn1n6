## OAuth Scopes

#### RFC 6749, 3.3: Access Token Scope
```
The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings.
The strings are defined by the authorization server.
If the value contains multiple space-delimited strings, their order does not matter,
and each string adds an additional access range to the requested scope.
```

#### Examples
- Github Scopes
  - `repo` - full access to the repository
  - `public_repo` - access to users public repositories
  - `repo_deployment` - deployment permissions
  - `repo:invite` - permission to invite someone to the repository
  - `write:repo_hook` - grants access to write to the repository hooks
  - Ref: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps
  - too random and unpredictable- users need to re-learn everything for each part of the system
- Google Scopes
  - Analytics API: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics
  - App Engine API: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/appengine.admin
  - Cloud Billing API: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-billing
  - Google Chat API: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.delete
  - Tag Manager API: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tagmanager.readonly
  - Ref: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes
  - Fully qualified URLs - include the product name, resource the permission will be granted on and the action which will be granted.
  - oposite to Github Scopes
- Okta API Scopes
  - `okta.apps.manage`
  - `okta.apps.read`
  - `okta.authorizationServers.manage`
  - `okta.authoriationServers.read`
  - Ref: https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/oauth2/
  - Namespaces approach here is in the "middle" of Github and Google
  - Recommended approach for defining scopes - clear, simple, predictable and will be easiest to document and descibe to others
    without loading it with additional meaning.
- OpenID Connect Scopes
  - Extreme oposite of default OAuth
  - Workflow for defining scopes is:
      1. You always need to start with `openid`
      2. Then you need to include any combination of profile, email, address or phone
  - Ref: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims
  - The resulting ID token and all requests to the user infill endpoint, will include the related claims.

## Understanding the OAuth endpoints

#### Endpoints in the base OAuth 2.0 framework - RFC 6749 OAuth Core
- `/authorize`
  - The endpoint that the end user (resource owner) interacts with to grant permissions for the application to access the resource.
  - Could return an authorization code or an access token.
- `/token`
  - The endpoint that the application uses to trade an authorization code or refresh token for an access token
 
#### Everything else is optional

#### OpenID Connect Core
- `/userinfo`
  - The endpoint that the applications use to retrieve profile information about the authenticated user.
  - This returns a spec-defined set of fields, depending on the permissions (scope) requested

#### RFC 8414: OAuth Authorization Server Metadata Discovery
- `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
  - The endpoint that application use to retrieve the configuration information for the authorization server
  - This returns a spec-defined set of fields
#### RFC 7662: Token Introspection
- `/introspect`
  - The endpoint that application use to learn more about a token, whether it is active or not (not revoked, within expiration)
  - Optionally returns additional info such as expiration time, scopes included, etc.
#### RFC 7009: Token Revokation
- `/revoke`
  - The endpoint that applications use to deactivate (invalidate) a token
  - Valid for access or refresh tokens
 
These are the most important and most common endpoints. Other extensions may include other endpoints.
You need to remember that whe someone asks "Do you support OAuth" - their definition and you your definition on OAuth may not be the same.

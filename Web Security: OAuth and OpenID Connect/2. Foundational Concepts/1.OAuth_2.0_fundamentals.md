## OAuth 2.0 Fundamentals

#### OAuth Concepts - 7 important terms
- Resource owner - that's you
- Resource server - what you're granting access to
- Grant type - how application is asking for access
- Scope - what access the application is requesting - read, write, profile or more - will vary between applications
- Authorization server - who the application is asking for access
  OAuth doesn't define the internal operations of the auth server, so policies could be based on anything - group membership, scopes requested, time of day, etc.
- Token - how the application gets that access - could be JWT or something else
- Claims - the content or information in the token - regardless of the type of token.
  JWTs contain claims into them, otherwise the token need to be used against URL on the Auth server to figure out the claims.
- Resource server - validates the token, review the permissions granted and allow requesting the application access.

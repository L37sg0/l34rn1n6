## Security Considerations

#### Requirements
- Use TLS
- The client secret is a credential - protect it
- Validate the access token
- Protect the access token

#### The actual risk is much bigger than in other autorization flows
- Your user is giving their credentials to the application
- Do we want to train our users to put their credentials anywhere ? - NO
- Do we trust the application and all the developers ?
- Scopes don't limit access here
- Only way to revoke provided access is to change your password

#### The only valid use case
- "Wrapping" legacy systems in an OAuth interface to bring them under the same security practices

#### Remember: It's Temporary
- But even when it's legitimate, it should be temporary. The risks are too high.
- Move to a better flow, like Authorization Code or PKCE, as soon as you can.

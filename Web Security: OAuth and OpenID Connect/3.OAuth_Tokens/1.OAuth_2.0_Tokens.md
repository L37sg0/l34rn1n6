## OAuth 2.0 Tokens

#### Type of Tokens
- Tokens in OAuth Core
  - `Access Token`
  - `Refresh Token`
- OpenID Connect
  - `ID Token`

#### RFC 6749, 1.4: Access Token
```
An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client.
The string is usually opaque to the client.
Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and
enforced by the resource server and authorization server.
```
- Grant access to things
- Probably should expire "quickly", in minutes to hours

#### RFC 6749, 1.5: Refresh Token
```
A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to the client by the resource owner.
The string is usually opaque to the client. The tooken denotes an identifier
used to retrieve the authorization information.
```
- Usually is used for the only purpose of asking for a new `access_token`.
- Only for the use with the authorization server
- Probably should last longer, from hours to days, weeks for some things.

#### OpenID Connect Core, 2: ID Token
```
The primary extension that OpenID Connect makes to OAuth 2.0 to enable End-Users to be
Authenticated is the ID TOken data structure. The ID TOken is a security token
that contains Claims about the Authentication of an End-User by an Authorization Server
when using a Client, and potentially other requested Claims. The ID Token is represented as a JSON Web Token(JWT).
```

#### Definition of Opaque Tokens
- There's nothing to see in them
- strings that serve as unique identifiers

#### JSON Web Tokes (JWT)
- It's the alternative to the "Opaque tokens"
- Full of authorization and profile data
- base64-encoded JSON documents
- should have signature information to verify both who sent it and the data in it

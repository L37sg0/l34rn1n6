## Handling Tokens

#### Tokens are credentials
- treat them and protect them as such
- shouldn't embed them in client-side code
- store them in secure cookies which can be used over HTTPS

#### Contents of the tokens
- Do not embed sensitive data in ID Tokens
- better approach is to use that token at the resource server to request the sensitive information from the server.
  That protects both the token and the end user.

#### The design chalenge
- We need to choose token type and lifetime, speciffic of the case.
  - Access Token
    - Read-only access, low-risk data: long expiration - example non-personal data
    - Read-only access, sensitive data: shorter expiration - example personal data
    - Read/write access, sensitive data: very short expiration - example bank account data
    Because often revoketion is not icluded in such OAuth implementation, Refresh tokens come into place
  - Refresh Token - used to retrieve new access token. Should reflect if user access has been revoked, or user has been deactivated

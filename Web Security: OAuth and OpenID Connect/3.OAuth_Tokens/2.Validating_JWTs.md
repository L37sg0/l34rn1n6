## Validating JWTs

#### Validating Established Trust
- JWTs must be validated in any circumstances
- Competelly optional in OAuth
- OIDC relies on them
- Before requesting a JWT you must request or find the validating keys

#### Definition of a JWT
- every JWT consists of 3 parts
  - header - tels us the algorithm used to generate the token
  - payload - the data you want to use, BUT first you need to validate the token with the signature
  - signature - lets us validate by who the token was sent, and included data was not modified
- Non valid JWTs must be rejected
- After validation we move to claims. Claims are the fields in the payload.
- Claims that should be respected
  - `iss` - the issuer of the token. Usually will be the authorization server
  - `sub` - the subject. This is the entity the token is about. Usually will be the end user who authenticated, or the system who requested the token.
  - `aud` - the intended audience of the token. Normally it's going to be the application.
  - `iat` - issued at time. Simple timestamp, which help you identify how old the token is.
  - `exp` - expiration time. Another timestamp, which tells you when token will expire and you must stop using the token.
     When token expires you must request a new one, because user information may have changed.

##### Validating JWTs is important step, so it's important to use a good library. Libraries in many programming languages available at https://jwt.io

## OAuth 2.0 - Device Code Grant Type

#### RFC 8628 Device Code Grant Type
- not a part of core OAuth 2.0, but an extension
- It's a flow for anything with internet connection, which lacks a browser for handling HDB redirects,
  or is generaly an input constrained, which would make typing a password painful or even imposible.

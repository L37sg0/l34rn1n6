## OAuth 2.0 - Device Code Grant Type

#### RFC 8628 Device Code Grant Type
- not a part of core OAuth 2.0, but an extension
- It's a flow for anything with internet connection, which lacks a browser for handling HDB redirects,
  or is generaly an input constrained, which would make typing a password painful or even imposible.

#### Explanation
- User requests access to a resource via device which could not be trusted - game console or some IOT device or etc.
- The device makes request to the authorization server which returns a QR code to the screen of the device.
- The user scans the QR code with his phone and is redirected to a login portal, where he puts his credentials safelly.
- Then, still on the phone, the user gives permission to his account to the device.
- The authorization server sends an access token and a refresh token to the device
- The device stores them, and requests new access token regularly, using grant type refresh token.
- This way user logged in securelly into his account through his phone, but can use his account resources on the untrusted device.

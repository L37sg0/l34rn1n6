## Client Credentials Flow - Security Considerations

#### Requirements:
- Always use SSL/TLS
- Users won't and can't see this flow
- Should log and monitor the system for bad behaviour -since this approach is not tied to speciffic user, account or even an action.
- Validate your tokens

##### Client Credentials flow is not necessarily for all devices
- Not for IOT devices

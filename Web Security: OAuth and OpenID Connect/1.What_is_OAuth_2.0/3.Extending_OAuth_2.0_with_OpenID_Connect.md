## Extending OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect

- OAuth 2.0
  - Target is to delegate authorization, effectivelly, to allow another system to act on my behalf.
  - Loosely defined
  - Unstructured tokens
  - Numerous extensions
  - Access and refresh tokens
  - Authorize and token endpoints
  - Authorization Code, Implicit, Resource Owner PAssword and Client Credentials
- OIDC (OpenID Connect)
  - Adds rigid structure to the user's profile data
  - Strictly structured JWTs
  - Numerous extensions
  - +ID tokens
  - +UserInfo endpoint
  - -(Not Client Credentials though)
 
OIDC is not alternative to OAuth, but extension on top of it. Everything we have in OAuth, we have in OIDC, with small differences.

- Sample ID token when decoded
```json
  {
   "iss": "http://server.example.com",
   "sub": "248289761001",
   "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
   "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
   "exp": 1311281970,
   "iat": 1311280970,
   "name": "Jane Doe",
   "given_name": "Jane",
   "family_name": "Doe",
   "gender": "female",
   "birthdate": "0000-10-31",
   "email": "janedoe@example.com",
   "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
  }
```

## Making OAuth 2.0 useful with extensions
- OAuth is written in 2012.It was wrote as a framework.

#### Difference between specification and framework
- Specification describes all the internal details of how something will work.
- Framework describes the boundaries and how the things will interact.

  This makes OAuth a challenge, but in trade we have room to add extensions to address new use cases.

#### Extensions:
- OpenID Connect
  - Provides a standart way to request and shape profile data
  - Gives us "Sign in with..." on hundreds of sites/
  - Depends on JSON Web Tokens - JWTs
- RFC 7519 - JSON Web Tokens - JWT
  - OAuth doesn't require JWTs, but they're common
  - JWT's are encoded, not encrypted
  - uses JSON Web Encryption
  - Includes `iss` (issuer), `iat` (issued at), `sub` (subject), `aud` (audience) and `exp` (expiration)
- RFC 7662 - Token Introspection
  - Examines a token to describe its contents
  - Useful for opaque tokens
  - Describes if the token is active or not
  - Mandatory if you have Token Revocation
- RFC 7009 - Token Revocation
  - Revokes (cancels) a token via API
  - Technically optional
  - In practice is required
#### End user-facing extensions
- RFC 8636 - Auth Code with PKCE
  - useful for protecting cliend-side flows (mobile devices, SPAs)
  - Replaces the implicit grand type
#### Architecture related extensions
- RFC 8693 - Token Exchange
  - Introduces an approach for trading or exchanging tokens on behalf of another user or service. Also could be called `delegation`

All extensions are optional, so to know which of them the provider supports, there is the next extension
- RFC 8414 - Authorization Server Metadata
  - gives an endpoint, which when queried gives information which extensions our OAuth implementation supports.
  - Unfortunatelly it is also optional
